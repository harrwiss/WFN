# WFN (Windows Firewall Notifier)

## Project Description
WFN started as a hobby around 2010 and is an "extension" to the embedded Windows firewall, and offers real time connections monitoring, connections map, bandwidth usage monitoring...

It has been made open source a few years ago.  

Please read the documentation about the features and limitation of WFN. Especially note that WFN is **not** a firewall itself!  

## Last update
**2018.03.03 - v2.0 beta 3**  
Head to the [releases page](https://github.com/wokhansoft/WFN/releases/tag/v2.0-beta3) if you are interested in trying the latest beta version, and **keep in mind, this is work in progress! Read the full description page before downloading!**  

## Requirements  
WFN requires Windows Vista SP2 or later (Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10...) with Microsoft .NET 4.5.2 or higher. Windows Server 2008 or later are not officially supported, but WFN should work fine on them.  
A .Net Core 3.1 version is on the way, removing the requirement for a .NET framework on the user's computer (as it will be embedded with the application itself).

_Please do not ask for a Windows XP version, since WFN relies on features introduced with Vista, it would require too much work. Well, now that it is open source, maybe someone will port it but keep in mind there are great alternatives out there. And, well, Windows XP is dead now, time to move on!_
