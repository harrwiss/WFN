# WFN (Windows Firewall Notifier - codename Wally)

**Please note that this is a fork of the original project [WFN](https://github.com/wokhansoft/WFN), which was created and maintained for years by wokhan and some others but stalled
for some time now.**

_Unfortunately since 2018 no new release has been published there, but since I like WFN and use it at home I invested some free time in the last few
months to learn and improve it in certain areas to my liking._

The project has now code name **Wally** for me ;)

## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to provide updated releases for people who like the original WFN and like to have some 
more up-to-date features and stability.

The original description is [here](https://github.com/wokhansoft/WFN)

## Version history

## Prerequisites  
WFN requires Windows Vista SP2 or later (Windows 7, 8, 8.1, 10...) with Microsoft .NET 4.5.2 or higher. 
Windows Server 2008 or later are not officially supported, but WFN should work fine on them.  

_Please note that I do only supply and support Windows 10 releases_
